# Generating API Keys

To use the Hey Bible API, you'll need to generate an API key from your account settings.

## Steps

1. Log in to [Hey Bible](https://heybible.app)
2. Navigate to the **Account** page
3. Under the "API Keys" section, click the **+** button to create a new key
4. Click **Copy** to copy the API key to your clipboard

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `X-Hey-Bible-Api-Key` header when making requests:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.heybible.app/verses" \
  -H "X-Hey-Bible-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Security Tips

- Keep your API key secret - don't commit it to version control
- Use environment variables to store your API key
- Regenerate your key if you suspect it has been compromised
